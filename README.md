Challenge
---------

Your challenge, if you choose to accept it, is to write a simple script that takes a shredded image in as input and outputs an unshredded and reconstituted image. That is, imagine if you took an image, divided it into an even number of columns and shuffled those columns randomly to produce a shredded image. Then, take that image into the script and output the original image.
